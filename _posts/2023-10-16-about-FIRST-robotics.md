_FIRST_<sup>®</sup> Robotics, founded in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen, aims to inspire young people to engage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) through hands-on robotics competitions. The flagship event, the _FIRST_<sup>®</sup> Robotics Competition (FRC), challenges high school teams to design, build, and program robots capable of performing specific tasks in a game-like environment. Each year, teams are presented with a new game that tests their robots’ agility, strategy, and collaboration skills. The competition fosters teamwork and problem-solving, with teams often comprised of students from diverse backgrounds working alongside mentors from the engineering community. Additionally, _FIRST_<sup>®</sup> offers programs for younger students, such as _FIRST_<sup>®</sup> LEGO League and _FIRST_<sup>®</sup> Tech Challenge, encouraging early interest in STEM. The ethos of _FIRST_<sup>®</sup> emphasizes gracious professionalism and collaboration, promoting a culture where teams celebrate each other's successes and learn from failures. Through competitions and workshops, _FIRST_<sup>®</sup> Robotics cultivates not only technical skills but also essential life skills, preparing participants for future challenges in their careers and communities. 

In FIRST Robotics competitions, the rounds consist of qualification matches and elimination rounds, each designed to test the robots' capabilities and the teams' strategies.

### Qualification Matches

During qualification rounds, each team competes in a series of matches, typically ranging from 8 to 12. In these matches, teams are randomly assigned to alliances, usually consisting of three robots each, which encourages collaboration. The matches last about two to three minutes and follow specific game rules set for that season.

For example, in the 2022 game "Rapid React," teams had to launch balls into high and low goals, navigate a series of obstacles, and climb onto a "hangar" at the end of the match. Points were awarded based on the number of balls scored, the robots' positions, and successful climbs, incentivizing strategic play and teamwork.

### Elimination Rounds

After qualification matches, the top teams advance to the elimination rounds, which consist of a series of head-to-head matches. The structure typically involves a bracket system:

1. **Quarterfinals**: The highest-ranked teams select their alliance partners to compete in matches against other alliances. These matches determine which alliances will advance.
   
2. **Semifinals**: Winning alliances from the quarterfinals face off, with the same elimination format. The competition can be fierce, as alliances often have to adapt their strategies based on the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents.

3. **Finals**: The last two alliances compete in a best-of-three format, with the winners crowned champions. This stage is particularly exciting, as it often features intense strategy discussions, quick adaptations, and high-stakes performances.

### Game Examples

Each year, the game changes, providing fresh challenges. For instance:

- In the 2020 game "Infinite Recharge," robots collected and scored power cells while navigating a central hub and attempting to climb at the end of the match. The dynamic of scoring in both high and low goals added layers of strategy.

- The 2023 game "Charged Up" introduced elements like moving obstacles and specific zones where robots could score points. Teams had to balance offense and defense, considering their robot's abilities and the opponents' strategies.

### Scoring and Strategy

Throughout the competition, teams must constantly analyze their performance, adapt their strategies, and communicate effectively with their alliance partners. The ability to adjust on-the-fly and work as a cohesive unit is crucial for success, making the competitive rounds a blend of technical skill and strategic gameplay. 

This multi-layered structure not only highlights the engineering skills involved in robot design but also the importance of teamwork, problem-solving, and real-time decision-making under pressure.
